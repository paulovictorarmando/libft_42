# ðŸ“š Libft - 42 School Project

Welcome to **Libft**, the foundational project of the 42 School curriculum. This project challenges us to build our own C library from scratch, implementing essential functions that will be used throughout our journey at 42. Itâ€™s an excellent starting point to practice low-level programming, understand how libraries work, and develop efficient code.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

The **Libft** project involves recreating some of the standard C library functions as well as additional utility functions. These functions are frequently used in subsequent projects, making **Libft** an essential toolkit for any 42 student.

## ðŸš€ Use
### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/paulovictorarmando/libft_42.git
cd libft_42
```
### 2.Build the Library
Use the Makefile to compile the source files and generate the libft.a static library:
```
make all
```
### 3. Clean Up
To remove object files and the compiled library, run:
```
make clean
make fclean
```
